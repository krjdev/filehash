### FileHash

FileHashCLI is a "rewrite from sratch" in C# from the original
programs md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum, sha384sum and sha512sum. These
programs are parts of the GNU core utilities.

The target OS is primary Windows. It also runs through Mono on Linux
and MacOSX. But it is prefered to use the default/original tools on
this platforms, they are maybe faster.

The original progams are copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation Inc. and written by Ulrich Drepper, Scott Miller und
David Madore.

Attention: This rewrite from scratch will not be maintained by
the Free Software Foundation Inc. If you find bugs, use the issue
tracker on GitHub.
