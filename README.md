**FileHash** is a "rewrite from sratch" in **C#** from the original programs *md5sum*, *sha1sum*, 
*sha256sum*, *sha384sum* and *sha512sum*. These programs are parts of the [GNU core utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html). 
The target OS is primary Windows. But it also runs through [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) 
on Linux and MacOSX. The original progams are copyrighted by the [Free Software Foundation Inc.](https://www.fsf.org/)
